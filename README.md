This is a tool to instantiate modules and connect ports for Verilog.
You can set source_path and the name of module_out in "configure.txt" 


connect(xx,xx):begin
xx-xx
xx-xx
xx-xx
end

The block above means the connection of two modules'ports, 'xx' represents the index of ports in the module(start from 1)
You can connect more modules by repeating the block
